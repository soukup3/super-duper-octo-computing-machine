# X-Team 11 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Create a Google Doc and people claim what they want to do. If people aren't able to
complete their task, communicate and reassign. Also we will use GitHub's assign feature.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Set completion deadlines for each team member and help them if they're having difficulties.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Tell each other what you are having problems with - use open communication.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Checkup on each other every now and then, keep messaging everyone in the groupchat,
and meet up before project is due.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Give constructive feedback and not take things personally. Have fun :)
